**`trw_ta`** is a Python library focused on converting TradingView Pine Script indicators into native Python for quantitative analysis and backtesting.  
It is developed and maintained for **The Real World** community to enable research and integration of Pine Script strategies into Python-based systems.

## âœ¨ Features

- One-to-one conversions of TradingView indicators to pandas-compatible Python functions.
- Clean, modular architecture for technical analysis workflows.
- Open-source for community contributions and expansion.
